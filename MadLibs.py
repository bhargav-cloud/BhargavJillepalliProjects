    madlibs = f"Hello, my comrade {plural_noun_1} in 2020. It's me, George Washington, \
 the first {occupation}. I am writing from (the) {location}, where I have been secretly living \
 for the past {number} years. I am concerned by the {adjective_1} state of affairs in America these days. \
It seems that your politicians are more concerned with {verb_end_ing1} one another than with listening to the \
{plural_noun_2} of the people. When we delcared our independence from (the) {location_2}, we set forth on a/an \
{adjective_2} path guided by the voices of the everyday {plural_noun_3}.If we're going to keep {verb_end_ing2}, then we need to learn \
how to respect all {plural_noun_4}. Don't get me wrong; we had {adjective_3} problems in my day too. Benjamin Franklin once called me a/an \
{noun} and kicked me in the {part_of_body}. But at the end of the day, we were able to {verb} in harmony. Let us find that {adjective_4} once again \
or else I'm taking {part_of_body2} off the quarters!!!!"
